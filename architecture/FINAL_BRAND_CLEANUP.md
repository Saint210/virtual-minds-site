## 📝 APPROVED FOUNDER STORY

**Use This Version:**

> "Virtual Minds was founded by a UCLA-trained psychiatrist who built and managed a multi-location psychiatric practice across California. When that practice closed, Virtual Minds was created to continue serving those clients and provide the specialized administrative support that psychiatric practices truly need."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Mentions UCLA training (legitimate)
- ✅ References multi-location practice management (experience is real)
- ✅ Explains transition without naming CalPsychiatry
- ✅ Focuses on solving real problems from practice experience

---

## 🚫 DO NOT MENTION

1. **CalPsychiatry** - Practice closed, clients transferred
2. **Dr. McNary's name** - Keep founder anonymous
3. **"6-week" or specific training timelines** - Unverified
4. **CURES, Ryan Haight, CMIA** - Too specific, unverified expertise
5. **"Board-Certified Psychiatrist designed"** - Implies named doctor involvement
6. **Specific number of psychiatrists** - From closed practice

---

## 📊 BRAND POSITIONING

### **Elevator Pitch:**
"Virtual Minds provides specialized virtual assistant and practice management services exclusively for California psychiatrists. Founded from real-world psychiatric practice experience, we handle medication management coordination, insurance verification, and administrative workflows—so you can focus on patient care."

### **Key Differentiator:**
"Unlike general mental health VA services, we specialize solely in psychiatric practice workflows. We understand medication management, prior authorizations, pharmacy coordination, and the unique administrative demands of California psychiatric practices—because we were built from one."

### **Target Market:**
- Solo California psychiatrists
- Small psychiatric groups (2-10 providers)
- Medication management-focused practices
- Telehealth psychiatric practices
- Transitioning from hospital/group to private practice
