## 7. Silo Architecture (The Website Structure)

The website is architected to capture traffic at every stage of the psychiatrist's journey.

**Level 1: The Core Hub (Homepage)**
*   `/` – The central command. Aggregates all services and establishes the "California Specialist" authority.

**Level 2: The Service Silos (Solutions)**
*   `/services` – The catalogue of capabilities.
    *   `/services/virtual-assistant` – **Core Product.** (Keyhook: "Stop answering phones.")
    *   `/services/billing-and-rcm` – **Revenue Stability.** (Keyhook: "Get paid faster.")
    *   `/services/practice-start-up` – **New Business.** (Keyhook: "Launch in 30 days.")
    *   `/services/website-design` – **Digital Presence.** (Keyhook: "Patient acquisition engine.")

**Level 3: The Knowledge Silo (Authority)**
*   `/blog` – "Insights." High-level articles on running a practice.
    *   *Example:* "How to Choose a California Psychiatric VA"
*   `/resources` – Deep-dive niche content.
    *   *Examples:* Checklists, Whitepapers, Payer Lists (Anthem vs. Blue Shield).

**Level 4: The Conversion Silo (The Trap)**
*   `/book-consultation` – **The Diagnostic Engine.**
    *   Replaces the generic "Contact Us" with a **4-Step Practice Audit**.
    *   Captures high-fidelity data (EHR type, Practice Size) *before* the call.
    *   Qualifies leads instantly (Solo vs. Group).
