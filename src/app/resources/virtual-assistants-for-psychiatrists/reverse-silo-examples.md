# California Medi-Cal Billing: How Virtual Assistants Save Practices $17,000 Monthly

**Introduction**
Most California psychiatrists lose 15+ hours monthly on Medi-Cal billing headaches. Here's the tested solution.

**Key Data Points:**
- Average denial rate: 23% without specialized VA
- With psychiatric VA: 4% denial rate
- Time saved: 8.2 hours/month

## How This Creates the Reverse Silo

**Link Flow:**
```
Article 1 (Medi-Cal) → Target Page + Article 2
Article 2 (Insurance) → Target Page + Article 3  
Article 3 (Scheduling) → Target Page + Article 1
```

**No External Links:** Each article only links internally
**No Random Internal Links:** No links to unrelated pages
**All Link Juice Downward:** Every article flows to Target Page

**SEO Result:**
Google sees strong authority signals for `/virtual-assistant-for-psychiatrists` because multiple related articles all point to it as the definitive resource.

**The Math:**
- 3 supporting articles × 1 internal link each = 3 links to Target Page
- Plus interlinking between supporting articles = 3 additional internal links
- Total internal link value: 6 focused, relevant links
- Zero diluted link authority

This is how Reverse Silo Method works in practice.
